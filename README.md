# Compare_RFR_SVR_XGBoost
In this script, which is an extension of the park visitation study in America's Big 10 cities, we compared two ensemble ML and one kernel-based models: Random Forest and XGBoost, and Support Vector Regressor. The model with the best performance at predicting visits across cities was eventually accepted to model individual city.
